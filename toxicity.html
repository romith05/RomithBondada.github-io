									<h1>Comment Toxicity Classification Using BERT and GNN</h1>
									<p>The major objective of this study is to develop a language model to recognize and 
									categorize the toxic comments that might be found on social media. A challenge with 
									classifying harmful remarks is that a single comment can belong to more than one 
									category or label. Therefore, traditional approaches like Naive Bayes, SVM, or others 
									cannot handle this type of categorization effectively because a model needs to 
									comprehend language context in order to analyse poisonous comments. Therefore, the 
									study included the use of BERT and GNN. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation 
									from Transformers), which can learn language in both directions, and GNN (Graph 
									Neural Network) Model, which is a clever technique to train a graph model. The BERT is 
									used to extract semantics and these semantics are fed to GNN. When the two models are 
									trained together they give the best results for comment classification. 
                                        </p>
									<p>Toxicity in online communication has become a prevalent issue in recent years, with the 
										increasing use of social media platforms and online forums. Toxic comments not only 
										have the potential to harm individuals and groups, but also create a negative 
										environment for discussion and debate. As a result, the automatic detection and 
										classification of toxic comments has become an important area of research. It has a 
										negative impact on userâ€™s mental health also and the participation of people from 
										different backgrounds when hateful and insulting language is used on social media sites. 
										Historically, categorical datasets with large amounts of data have been used extensively 
										in automatic foul language identification. The severity of offensiveness varies, though. 
										The proposed GNN and BERT architecture gives the accurate result. The toxicity score is 
										calculated in the range of 0 to 1.</p>

									<h3>Methodology:</h3>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot 2025-01-18 181912.png" alt="" /></div>
									<p>Advancing to the proposed methodology, you can see the model architecture in fig(2.1). 
										The model architecture reveals that we are working with generative AI models, 
										specifically BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GAN 
										(Generative Adversarial Networks). These models are referred to as generative 
										models because they can anticipate and generate new words based on words they have 
										previously observed. Now, by adding a small amount of labelled data to the equation, 
										you can tune them to carry out common NLP tasks like classification or named entity 
										recognition. This process is known as tuning, and it is essentially what we are doing when 
										we use BERT to detect toxicity levels in the input comments. If they exceed the toxicity 
										threshold (>0.5), they are then forwarded to GAN model for detoxification. </p>

									<h3> Graph Neural Network (GNN):</h3> 
									<p>With links represented as edges and entities as nodes, graph-structured data can be 
										handled effectively with the help of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). They are 
										excellent at identifying complex relationships and patterns in relational datasets, which 
										makes them useful for a variety of applications, including molecular chemistry, social 
										network analysis, and recommendation systems. Fundamentally, GNNs use iterative 
										information aggregation to update node embeddings by taking into account 
										information from nearby nodes as well as local features. Convolutional operations on 
										graphs are used by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), a well-liked GNN 
										architecture, to efficiently spread information. Managing graphs of different length and 
										preventing over-smoothing are two problems with GNNs. Still, research is being done 
										to improve GNNs and create variations such as Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to 
										increase their capabilities, making them more and more</p>

									<p>During training, backpropagation is utilized to update model parameters. Adjustments 
										to weights are made using arithmetic operations involving gradients and learning rates, 
										ensuring that both semantic and bias-related information contribute to the learning 
										process. </p>
